Long before we had words like gaslighting or emotional manipulation, Chanakya, the ancient master of strategy,
 saw these games for what they were: traps of the mind.
 He knew that manipulators rarely roar like tigers. 
They come disguised as friends, family, or advisors, people who use your trust and emotions to pull your strings.
